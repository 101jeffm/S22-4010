More on Go, Stocks
======================

Goroutines
------------------------------

Go routes allow you to create parallel running code.


```Go
m4_include(ex0.go.nu)
```





Go Interfaces
------------------------------

Two uses for interfaces (Actually more than 2 but 2 primary uses).

1. Variable parameter list functions.
2. Interfaces to sets of functions.

## Variable parameter list functions.

Also an example of reflection.

```Go
m4_include(vardac.go.nu)
```

## Interfaces to sets of functions.

```Go
m4_include(ex2.go.nu)
```

Go Channels
------------------------------

We will come back to this later.


Go Weaknesses
------------------------------

What are the limitations of using Go

1. No objects - Use interfaces instead.  No inheritance.
2. Executables are big
