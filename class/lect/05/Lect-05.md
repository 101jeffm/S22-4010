## News

1. Crypto Crash....

New York Times, Today, Fri Jan 28 06:18:24 MST 2022 <br>
[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/opinion/cryptocurrency-subprime-vulnerable.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/opinion/cryptocurrency-subprime-vulnerable.html)

"Recent developments in El Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as legal
tender a few months ago, seem to bolster the skeptics: Residents
attempting to use the currency find themselves facing huge transaction
fees. Still, crypto has been effectively marketed: It manages both
to seem futuristic and to appeal to old-style goldbug fears that
the government will inflate away your savings, and huge past gains
have drawn in investors worried about missing out. So crypto has
become a large asset class even though nobody can clearly explain
what legitimate purpose itâ€™s for."

2. Turkey - attempting to support the Lyra - ForEx down to 7.55B, 
with $10-11b a month in foreign gas purchases.  An inflation forcast
from the CBT (Central Bank of Turkey) of 22.3% - and - desperate 
measures.  If a country can't support its own currency how do you
expect Teather to support it's?

3. Facebooks, Deim project offically shuts down.

"...so that it would be pegged to the U.S. dollar to create more stability..."

"...16 percent of Americans have invested in or traded cyptocurrencies..."

From: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2020/08/31/most-americans-dont-have-a-real-stake-in-the-stock-market/?sh=5783d5331154](https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2020/08/31/most-americans-dont-have-a-real-stake-in-the-stock-market/?sh=5783d5331154)

"...via the Federal Reserve from 2016, shows a relatively small
share of American families (14%) are directly invested in individual
stocks but a majority (52%) have some market investment mostly from
owning retirement accounts such as 401(k)s."

More On Go 
====================

Maps do not synchronize automatically.
So... Synchronization Primitives:

```Go
  1: package main
  2: 
  3: import (
  4:     "fmt"
  5:     "sync"
  6:     "time"
  7: )
  8: 
  9: // SafeCounter is safe to use concurrently.
 10: type SafeCounter struct {
 11:     v   map[string]int
 12:     mux sync.Mutex
 13: }
 14: 
 15: // Inc increments the counter for the given key.
 16: func (c *SafeCounter) Inc(key string) {
 17:     c.mux.Lock()
 18:     // Lock so only one goroutine at a time can access the map c.v.
 19:     c.v[key]++
 20:     c.mux.Unlock()
 21: }
 22: 
 23: // Value returns the current value of the counter for the given key.
 24: func (c *SafeCounter) Value(key string) int {
 25:     c.mux.Lock()
 26:     // Lock so only one goroutine at a time can access the map c.v.
 27:     defer c.mux.Unlock()
 28:     return c.v[key]
 29: }
 30: 
 31: func main() {
 32:     c := SafeCounter{v: make(map[string]int)}
 33:     for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
 34:         go c.Inc("somekey")
 35:     }
 36: 
 37:     time.Sleep(time.Second)
 38:     fmt.Println(c.Value("somekey"))
 39: }


```

### A Go Core/Panic 

First the Code

```Go
  1: package main
  2: 
  3: import "fmt"
  4: 
  5: var mm map[string]int
  6: 
  7: func main() {
  8:     fmt.Println("vim-go")
  9:     mm["bob"] = 3
 10: }


```

Then the bad output.


```
vim-go
panic: assignment to entry in nil map

goroutine 1 [running]:
main.main()
	/Users/philip/go/src/github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/S22-4010/class/lect/04/go_panic.go:9 +0x71
exit status 2


```
